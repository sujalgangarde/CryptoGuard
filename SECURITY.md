This security policy serves as a foundation for establishing robust security measures to protect EncryptXpert and the sensitive data it processes. Regular adherence to these guidelines, coupled with ongoing monitoring and adaptation to evolving threats, will help maintain a secure environment for EncryptXpert users and their data.

**1. Data Encryption:**

-   All sensitive data processed by EncryptXpert must be encrypted using AES-EAX or AES-GCM algorithms.
-   Encryption keys and nonces must be securely generated and managed to prevent unauthorized access to encrypted data.

**2. Access Control:**

-   Access to EncryptXpert's GUI and CLI tools should be restricted to authorized personnel only.
-   User authentication mechanisms, such as passwords or biometric verification, must be implemented to control access to the application.

**3. Secure Transmission:**

-   When transferring encrypted files, ensure that secure communication protocols (e.g., HTTPS, SSH) are used to prevent data interception or tampering.

**4. Secure Storage:**

-   EncryptXpert application files, configuration files, and encryption keys must be stored securely to prevent unauthorized access.
-   Utilize encryption mechanisms for sensitive data stored locally or remotely to protect against unauthorized access.

**5. Logging and Monitoring:**

-   Implement logging mechanisms to record all encryption and decryption activities performed using EncryptXpert.
-   Regularly review logs for suspicious activities or unauthorized access attempts.

**6. Updates and Patch Management:**

-   Ensure EncryptXpert is kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates to mitigate known vulnerabilities.
-   Regularly monitor security advisories and apply patches promptly to address any identified security vulnerabilities.

**7. Employee Training and Awareness:**

-   Provide comprehensive training to employees on the proper use of EncryptXpert and adherence to security policies.
-   Promote awareness of cybersecurity best practices and the importance of data protection among all personnel.

**8. Incident Response:**

-   Establish procedures for responding to security incidents, including data breaches or unauthorized access attempts.
-   Maintain a clear escalation path and response plan to address security incidents promptly and effectively.

**9. Compliance and Regulatory Requirements:**

-   Ensure EncryptXpert complies with relevant data protection regulations and industry standards (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA).
-   Regularly review and update security policies to align with evolving compliance requirements.

**10. Third-Party Integration:**

-   When integrating third-party libraries or tools with EncryptXpert, ensure they adhere to security best practices and undergo thorough security assessments.

**11. Continuous Improvement:**

-   Continuously assess and enhance EncryptXpert's security posture through regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing.
-   Solicit feedback from users and stakeholders to identify areas for improvement and implement necessary security enhancements.

**12. Policy Review and Updates:**

-   Regularly review and update the EncryptXpert security policy to address emerging threats, technological advancements, and changes in organizational requirements.

## ⚠️ Warning: 
Please note that EncryptXpert may encounter occasional issues with the built-in key database system, leading to database failures. Additionally, file integrity may occasionally be compromised during the encryption or decryption process. While efforts are ongoing to address these issues, users are advised to maintain backups of their encrypted files and exercise caution when relying solely on EncryptXpert for data protection.
